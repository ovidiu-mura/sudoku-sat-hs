You are looking at a very simplistic encoder of 9x9 Sudoku
instances into CNF SAT instances, together with a very
simplistic decoder of SAT assignments of these instances
into solved Sudoko instances, and a shell script that
automates the whole process.

The solvers currently supported by the shell script are
picosat and minisat2, which are available in
Debian. However, most any decent SAT solver should be
workable.  You will also need an installation of ghc,
including the runghc command. (Other Haskells should work
also, haven't tried it.)

Take a look at the sudoku-9x9 directory for examples of the
input format. The output format is the same.

Bugs:

  * The decoder should check that the solution returned is a
    valid Sudoku, and probably should check that it is valid
    for the input instance.

  * Standard 9x9 Sudoku is currently hardwired in. You could
    easily change it to 16x16, but only by changing a
    constant in the encoder and in the decoder. You'd also
    have to change the input and output to deal with e.g.
    letters instead of digits.

Have fun.
